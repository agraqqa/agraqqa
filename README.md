- 👋 Hi, I’m @agraqqa 🐦‍⬛
- 👀 I’m interested in devops and coding
- My main devops tools are `ansible`, `terraform`, `bash`, `datadog`, `gitlab`, `forgejo`, `drone`, `docker`/`podman`, `1password (op)`
- I like to code using `python` and `golang`, but `Fortran 77` is my first love. Learning `rust`.
- Ain't no social media guy at all
